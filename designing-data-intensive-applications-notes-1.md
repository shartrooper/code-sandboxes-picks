## Data-intensive applications fundamental ##  
Typically built from standard building blocks that provide commonly needed functionality. For example, many applications need to:
* Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (databases)
* Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (caches)
* Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (search indexes)
* Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (stream pro‚Äê
cessing)
* Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (batch processing)
